# Multimodal Deep Learning for movie genre classification

Experiments mainly based on:

* [MulT](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1656.pdf) "Multimodal Transformer for Unaligned Multimodal Language Sequences"
* [MMBT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02950) "Supervised Multimodal Bitransformers for Classifying Images and Text".
* [Moviescope Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03180) "Moviescope: Large-scale Analysis of Movies using Multiple Modalities"

The task is to predict the movie genres from movie trailers (video frames and audio spectrogram), movie plot (text), poster (image) and metadata.
